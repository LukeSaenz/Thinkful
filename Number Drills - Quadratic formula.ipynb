    "Remember all those quadratic equations you had to solve by hand in highschool? Well, no more! You're going to solve all the quadratic equations you might ever[1] have to wrangle with in the future once and for all by coding up the quadratic formula to handle them automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function quadratic_formula() that takes three arguments, a, b, and c that represent the coefficients in a formula of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Your function shoud return a list with two elements where each element is one of the two roots. If the formula produces a double root the result should be a list where both elements are that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, quadratic_formula(2, 16, 1) should return the list [-0.06299606299409444, -7.937003937005906]. The order of the roots is not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Well, not ever ever. You don't need to worry about getting quadratic equations with complex roots where you need the square root of a negative number. All the test cases will be for equations with real roots."
